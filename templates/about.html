<h2>Pure Client Side</h2>
<p>
This application is built in a way that all the logic is delegated to the client.
This means that the amount of requests made to the server can be minimized and that
this application can potentially run by being loaded locally. The server is only
interrogated for JSON objects that do not manipulate the DOM of the page.
